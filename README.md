# studentdebt
A GitHub repository hosting research that aims to distinguish the factors affecting average student debt among bachelor's degree holders with student debt.

## Requirements
Python 3.11 and the following libraries:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Geopandas
- Colour
- Scipy

## About
This is a research project made under Renaissance Learning's EXL program run by Jon Stelman and Justin Alt. The project focuses on bachelor's degree holders with student debt and compares their average student debt to a variety of factors related to demographics, education, institution characteristics and income, and socioeconomic status. 

## Notebooks
All code in this repository is written within Jupyter Notebook. The code is divided into four main notebooks:
- 1: An exploratory notebook that explains the creation of a few basic functions and shows the first steps of the graphing process
- 2: A functions notebook that lays out the entirety of the functions used to process data
- 3: An analysis notebook that uses those functions to graph and analyze data that is used in the report
- 4: An analysis notebook for data from the Delta Cost Project, which outlines the process used to identify example institutions and their related data

## Data
The data used comes from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS), and the Delta Cost Project. We use Python to clean, sort, and display the data within Jupyter Notebook.
